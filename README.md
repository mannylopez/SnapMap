# SnapMap

![Demo](assets/demo.png)

SnapMap is a photo slideshow app to explore and relive your trips through a combination of photos, videos, and geographic data.

Works completely offline. No need to upload any photos or data. Download this project, point it to your media, and run it locally.

It's pretty sparse and the initial set up is manual for now, but it worked really well as a quick home-cooked meal sort of app (see [An app can be a home-cooked meal](https://www.robinsloan.com/notes/home-cooked-app/)).
